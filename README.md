You need ipython and python notebooks. You also need to install Pytmatrix, just follow the instructions from https://github.com/jleinonen/pytmatrix/wiki

pytmatrix.pdf summarizes main principles of scattering calculations using the T-matrix method. It also gives an overview of the Pytmatrix use. If interested more examples were prepared by Davide Ori and can be found here: https://github.com/DaveOri/tmatrix_course
